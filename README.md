This is a simple XNA 4.0 application that records microphone audio and allows playback of audio.

This was created to show that this code works perfectly in XNA 4.0 but does not work in MonoGame 3.8.1.303.a

Original issue was from a forum post at https://community.monogame.net/t/cant-get-microphone-to-work-properly-in-monogame-3-8-1/19332
